# *Gameverse Insights Dashboard - Tableau Project*

## 📌 Project Overview
As a data analyst, I aim to create a multi-dashboard Tableau project using a global video game sales dataset to provide users with a comprehensive, interactive exploration of game performance, trends, and insights across different dimensions such as platforms, genres, companies, and critic scores. The dashboards will serve both casual gaming enthusiasts and business stakeholders who are interested in industry patterns and sales performance.
